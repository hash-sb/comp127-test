# Instructions, Version 1

Identify the bent horizontal metal rod located 3 feet above the ground on the right side of the large metal rectangle. Decrease the angle of your elbow and, if necessary, increase the angle of your upper arm from your torso such that your hand is level with the metal lever. With your fingers extended, move your hand forward so that the metal lever is located in the crook of the hand between the thumb and the other fingers. Curl your fingers around the metal lever until they make full contact with it. Move your hand and wrist so that the level rotates clockwise around an axis near its left end and perpendicular to the door. While maintaining this hand position, move forward, causing the whole metal rectangle to rotate about an axis on its left side and perpendicular to the floor.
