## ASTs: what and why?

(aim for ≤5 min; they only need a quick intro to get the activity started)

- Draw tree for a _very_ simple example, e.g. `2 * 3 - 4`
  - Show values at each node
  - 1-2 examples will suffice. No need to get complicated at the whiteboard; activities will get into it!
- AST stands for “abstract syntax tree”
  - This probably feels kind of familiar / easy for simple arithmetic, but almost all code has a structure like this!
  - This is about learning to analyze code
  - Actual programming languages like Java construct an AST when they run the program
  - Learning to see code the way the computer sees it will help you understand lots of otherwise confusing things!
- Rules of these ASTs:
  - Values start at the bottom and flow up
  - If you're unsure where to start, remember: the thing at the _top_ is the thing that happens _last_
  - Left vs. right matters! (e.g. subtraction)

## Pair programming: what and why?

(also ≤5 min, more to come in the next class)

- Programming is highly collaborative
  - Software is made by teams
  - Communication is a key software dev skill
  - Explaining yourself is a key skill
  - Asking for help and saying when you don’t know is a key skill
- Also this helps in the classroom
  - Students who are confused have support, aren’t struggling alone
  - Students who understand (or thing they do) can’t just speed ahead on autopilot; they have to _slow down_ and _communicate_
- Key goal: make sure **everyone** in your activity pair/group understands each part
  - It’s not a race! Nobody is impressed if you’re fast
  - _Quality_ of learning is what matters
