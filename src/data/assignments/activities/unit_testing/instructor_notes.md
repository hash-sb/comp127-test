# Instructor notes: unit testing

## other ideas for unit testing assignments, problems

From Dan, fall 2025: let's ask chatbots to make an assignment and see
what they do.

Prompt:

> You are a college computer science teacher, teaching an introductory
> Java course. Write an assignment on unit testing. The focus should be
> on the concepts of unit testing and not the details of Java and junit.
> Include exercises that show the limitations of unit testing including
> missed test cases, incomplete code coverage, why 100% coverage is not
> sufficient, and how code can still have bugs even with good test
> cases. Think hard and make a high quality, well sequenced, and
> efficient prompt that has questions on explaining code and its flaws
> as well as writing short snippets of code. Include a
> markdown-formatted version of the assignment prompt. Include text for
> the student explaining the overall purpose and concepts in the
> assignment and how the assignment will be assessed.

- [Claude's response](example_unit_testing_assignment_claude.md)

Neither response is a drop-in replacement but both have some good
exercises, ideas, and questions. We could consider using those in the
future.
