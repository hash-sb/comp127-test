## Instructor note

In the grand tradition of computer science, the terminology here is confusing. The terms “array,” “list,” “vector,” and “tuple” can all means “an ordered sequence of items indexed by number.” These terms appear across many languages, but their _semantics_ varies a great deal from language to language. For example, for something called an "array", one language may or may not allow changing the size; it may or may not allow you to change the values stored. But another language may work differently for "array".

The particular distinction between lists and arrays that Java makes is a Java-specific thing. For example, Swift, Ruby, and JavaScript all have things that they call an “array” that are resizable, and resemble Java lists much more than Java arrays.

The moral here is to learn the terminology of the language you’re using, and be aware that computer science is a young and inconsistent discipline.

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

- What are the differences between an array and a list in Java?
- What is the point of having arrays if Java already has lists?
