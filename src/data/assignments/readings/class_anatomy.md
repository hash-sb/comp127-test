# Anatomy of a Class

## Reading

Please read [sections 6.1-6.5](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csjava/Unit6-Writing-Classes/topic-6-1-parts-of-class.html?mode=browsing){:.assignment} of the Introduction to Programming With Java book. This is an interactive, free online textbook.

**Note:** You should skip sections 6.3.3, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6 (6.3.3 to the end of the 6.3 subsection), which are concepts that we will not be using in this course.

## Important concepts

- <def>class</def>, <def>object</def>
- <def>state</def>
- <def>behavior</def>
- <def>scope</def>
- <def>encapsulation</def>
- <def>instance variable</def> (a.k.a <def entry="instance variable">member variable</def>, or in Java, <def entry="instance variable">field</def>)
- <def>visibility</def>, <def>access control</def>
- <def>getter</def> and <def>setter</def> (a.k.a. <def entry="getter">accessor</def> and <def entry="setter">mutator</def>)

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. Every class defines a constructor method (possibly implicitly). What is the purpose of a constructor?
2. Assume you are given code for a class called "Button" that represents a button on your screen. The Button constructor method takes four parameters: double xPosition, double yPosition, double width, double height. Write a single line of code to create a Button variable and initialize it at position (100, 200) with a width of 30 and a height of 20. 
3. Why do we declare instance (member) variables private? If they are private, what do we need to do in order to access them?
