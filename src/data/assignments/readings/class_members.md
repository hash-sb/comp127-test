## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. If you program a class and you do not code a constructor, does the class have a constructor? (OK, this one is from the tail end of 5.4 on last reading, but it’s good to revisit.)
2. Describe in your own words the difference between static (class) and non-static (instance) methods.
3. In what situations might method overloading be helpful?
