Consider the API and contract of each of the following classes:

- `Media` (from the Library activity; look at `checkIn()`, `checkOut()`, `isAvailable()`)
- `CannonBall` (from Bubble Blitz, analyze whole class)

Start with method signatures. Which methods are part of the API? Which are not? Are any constants or instance variables part of the API?

Then think about behavioral contracts. What are preconditions and postconditions of the interesting methods? Can you identify any class invariants?
