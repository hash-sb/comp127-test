## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. Why do we declare most instance variables as private, except when they are instead declared public static final? Would it be better to declare them all protected, just in case a subclass needs them? Or should we use protected only if absolutely necessary?
2. What is the purpose of the special function called super? What happens when code containing a super() call runs?
3. What is the point of abstract classes? Why would you ever want a class that you can't instantiate?
