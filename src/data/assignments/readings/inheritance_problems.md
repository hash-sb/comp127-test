- Optional, if you want to go deeper: Read [Item 18: Favor Composition Over Inheritance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUzPQxSQY26HaDeBT57_eP0y0Cjh5Hyi/view?usp=share_link){:.assignment} <small>(Bloch, Joshua. <i>Effective Java.</i> 3rd ed., Addison-Wesley Professional, 2017.)</small> The entire book is excellent, and [the Macalester library has it](https://macalester.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/1018432176?queryString=effective%20java)!

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. What does it mean for a class _B_ to be a subtype of class _A_? What are some strategies you can imagine to determine whether every instance of _B_ is really an _A_?
2. What happens when you override a method inherited from a superclass? Could you trace a series of method calls made be a subclass _B_ which inherits from and overrides methods in superclass _A_?
