# Java Basics

## Reading

- Read [this code](https://github.com/mac-comp127/java-basics/blob/main/src/javabasics/JavaBasics.java){:.assignment}. The code and its comments _are_ the reading.
- You can read the code in your browser at first, but it is a good idea to also **run the code** for yourself, see what it does, and **try experimenting with it**. Please **[follow these instructions](/resources/code-as-reading-procedure)** to get the code on your computer and play with it.

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. What’s the answer to the puzzle at the end? If you’re not sure, what _might_ it be? Make a guess. What experiment could you do to test that guess?
2. What _might_ possibly happen if you put something inside an if statement’s condition that is just a number, like `if(37)`? What do you think _should_ happen? Make a few guesses, then try it.
3. What other little experiments can you try on this code?
