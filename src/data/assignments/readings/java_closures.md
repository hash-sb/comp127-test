# Closures (aka Lambdas)

## Reading

- Read [CH 6.3: Lambda Expressions from “Core Java Volume 1 — Fundamentals” by Cay S. Horstmann](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14h3MrKrwXdeOw6teRWxXShyH50XHCldl/view?usp=sharing){:.assignment}. This reading mentions some concepts we have not covered in class (such as ActionListener, Comparator), but you should be able to understand the core points.

## Important concepts

- <def>closure</def> (a.k.a. <def entry="closure">lambda</def>)
- <def>variable capture</def>
- Java closure syntax variants
- <def>comparator</def>

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

- What is the difference between a lambda expression and a method?
- What is a functional interface? How is it connected to lambda expressions?
- How could you change the code at the bottom of page 323 to make it legal, but still use the value of the variable i in the lambda?
