# List Basics

## Reading

1. Read [this code](https://github.com/mac-comp127/list-basics/blob/main/src/listbasics/ListBasics.java){:.assignment}. The code and its comments _are_ the reading. (Remember to run the code for yourself, see what it does, and try experimenting with it. Here are [the instructions](/resources/code-as-reading-procedure) for doing that.)
2. Read [this short text about software testing](/resources/software-testing){:.assignment}.

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. In the nested loops example, try swapping lines 90 and 91 (i.e. switch which loop is inside and which loop is outside). How does the output change? Why?
2. Why would you guess it might be useful to have immutable lists? Shouldn’t all lists be mutable, just in case?
