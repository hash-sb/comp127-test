# Loop Basics

## Reading

- Read [this code](https://github.com/mac-comp127/loop-basics/blob/main/src/loopbasics/LoopBasics.java){:.assignment}. (Remember to run the code for yourself, see what it does, and try experimenting with it. Here are [the instructions](/resources/code-as-reading-procedure).)

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

1. What is the purpose of each of the three expressions that appear in the control line of a C-style for loop?
2. The reading mentions three common looping patters that we use in programming:

    | Pattern name          | Java idiom       | Java syntax                  |
    |-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
    | repeat until sentinel | while loop       | `while(___) { ... }`         |
    | do _n_ times          | C-style for loop | `for(___; ___; ___) { ... }` |
    | for each element      | for-each loop    | `for(___ : ___) { ... }`     |
    {:.compact}

    In what situations would you want to use each one of these?
