# Maps (aka Dictionaries)

## Reading

- Please read about [Map and HashMap](/resources/maps/){:.assignment}.
- You do not need to do the programming exercises in the reading, but you may find it helpful to try them a little. It’s up to you.

## Important concepts

- <def term="Map (data structure)">`Map` data structure</def> (also called a <def entry="Map (data structure)">dictionary</def> or <def entry="Map (data structure)">associative array</def> in other languages)
- keys vs values, <def>key-value pair</def>

## Things to consider <aside>(exercises for yourself, not to turn in)</aside>

- The Java `Map` interface has the `get()` method for looking up the value that corresponds to a given key. Why isn't there a method that goes in the other direction, i.e. looking up the key that corresponds to a given value?
- Is there a situation where `containsKey(x)` could return `true`, but then `get(x)` returns `null`? (Yes! What is it?)

## Your response

What do you hope to learn about maps from the in-class activity?
