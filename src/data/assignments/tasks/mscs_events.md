# Attend 3 MSCS Dept. Events

Over the course of the semester, attend **three** different events sponsored by either the Macalester MSCS Department or MSCS-related student orgs.

You may also use events that are not sponsored by the department but are related to computer science, mathematics, or statistics, as long you get the **prior approval of the instructor**.

Note that the [home page of this web site](/) lists upcoming department events! You can also add the [MSCS Events Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=macalester.edu_k7f54d0aeqnpvqb3kjl5kvnuvg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago) to your personal calendar (and toggle its visibility if you like) to make it easier to compare it to your own schedule.

For **each event** you attend, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/otZnvvnkimVPdBVk8).

- Each event counts as one task / reading credit.
- If you are taking another MSCS course with a similar attend-an-event requirement, it is fine to use the same event for both courses as long as the other course allows it. (Note that you still have to fill out _this_ course’s form to get credit in this course.)
- You cannot get extra credit in this course for attending more than three events, but you should attend more anyway!
