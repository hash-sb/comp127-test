# Project: Submission & Grading

{:standard_toc}

## Pre-submission checklist

- Everything is cleaned up and in good shape according to the [Style Guide](/resources/style-guide).
- The code works.
- No, really, you tested the project that _one extra time_ even though you already _know_ that it's working just to make sure it's _still_ working!
- The `README.md` file contains the final report.


## To submit your project

1. Double check everything in the checklist above.
1. Write "<highlight>**Ready for grading**</highlight>" on the final commit message.
1. Push!
1. _You pushed, right??_

Your final project grade is based on both the project quality and your individual contributions. After you submit your project, your instructor will ask you to complete a questionnaire describing the work that each team member did. **Look for that questionnaire in your email.** Your project is not submitted until you fill out that questionnaire!


## Grading rubric

What your instructor will look for when grading projects:

- Does it work? Did you test your code carefully and think about corner cases?
- Is the code readable, tidy, and clear? Does it follow the [Comp 127 style guide](/resources/style_guide)
- Is the project creative? Did you challenge yourself?

Here is the rubric we use for assigning grades:


### User experience and functionality <aside>(approx. 2/3 of total)</aside>

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 95+
[criteria]
  Creative, challenging, a pleasure to use:

  - Shows attention to detail
  - Shows care and polish in user experience
  - Has imaginative / creative touches
  - Tested carefully
  - Works reliably
  - Students challenged themselves, but chose their challenge wisely so they could make it really _good_

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 90
[criteria]
  Essential functionality works well enough to truly enjoy despite some minor bugs, glitches, and/or usability loose ends

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 85
[criteria]
  Basically works, but bugs or omissions greatly impact usability; not polished; does not work reliably

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 80
[criteria]
  Clear progress toward working code, but has essential functionality gaps or serious bugs; not really usable

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 75
[criteria]
  Visible progress, but mostly not working

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] <70
[criteria]
  Judgement call

||-----------------------------------------------------||

### Code style and structure <aside>(approx. 1/3 of total)</aside>

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 95
[criteria]
  Exemplifies the points in the [style guide](/resources/style_guide):

  - Clear efforts to make code readable: good class names, good method names, good variable names, good comments where they are helpful, effort to group things in ways that make sense
  - Proper indentation, readable formatting
  - Good problem decomposition
  - Every class and method has a clear purpose, and a name that reflects that purpose
  - Classes don’t have lots of semi-unrelated instance variables
  - No large chunks of repeated or nearly-repeated code
  - No unused / defunct code, no unused variables, no commented-out fragments
  - No massive methods
  - Good division of labor between classes
  - Uses good tools for solving problems: library methods when appropriate, appropriate data structure choices (Map vs List vs Set, custom classes instead of deeply nested lists of lists of lists)

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 90
[criteria]
  “A on Breakout” level of code quality: sensible enough organization, decent names for things, no egregious messes, at least some effort to comment

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 85
[criteria]
  General structure makes sense, but is not well decomposed; some names are confusing; some messy organization or formatting; some repetition; still shows some effort toward organization and readability

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 80
[criteria]
  Code works but shows little attention to anything beyond just getting it to work; general structure is a bit confusing, doesn’t show a fully thought-out design; code is messy and has repetition

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] 75
[criteria]
  Spaghetti code, mangled formatting / indentation, some stretches are incomprehensible, barely works

||-----------------------------------------------------||

[grade] <70
[criteria]
  Judgement call

||-----------------------------------------------------||
