# Course Project Proposal

[Submit your project proposal on Moodle](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=242766).

(Only one person from each group needs to upload the proposal.)

Your proposal should include:

* A title
* Your group's members
* A brief description (think of a single sentence / catchphrase)
* Drawings, if appropriate -- could be the UI, or a high-level diagram of the workflow / user interaction, etc.
* Tell us why your project is cool, interesting, useful, and so on!
* Describe a smaller, initial version of your project that you can build first. This will be a prototype, or proof of concept, or "minimum viable product". Something with a scope smaller than the full project.
* You should have shared your project idea with students outside your group. (See the ["getting started" section of the project page](https://comp127.innig.net/tasks/project/getting_started).) What did they say?

Submit your proposal, then start thinking about your plan. Start with the smaller initial version and go from there.
